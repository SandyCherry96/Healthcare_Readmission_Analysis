# 💡 Recommendations — Reducing Hospital Readmissions

## 1. Target High-Risk Patients at Discharge
Use risk scores to flag patients requiring enhanced discharge planning and follow-up.

## 2. Prioritize Elderly & Long-Stay Patients
Introduce post-discharge check-ins and care coordination for elderly patients and those with extended hospital stays.

## 3. Monitor High Utilization Patients
Patients with prior inpatient or emergency visits should be enrolled in care management programs.

## 4. Medication Reconciliation Programs
Patients with high medication counts should receive pharmacist-led medication reviews before discharge.

## 5. Data-Driven Resource Allocation
Hospitals should focus readmission prevention resources on the top risk quartile to maximize impact.

## 6. Integrate with Predictive Models
This SQL risk framework can directly support machine learning models for real-time readmission prediction.
